# 📅 Day 1 — IDC 21 Days of SQL Challenge

Today I kicked off the **IDC 21 Days of SQL Challenge** by revisiting SQL fundamentals —  
simple concepts that become powerful when used thoughtfully.​

## 🧠 What I Learned Today

- Viewing and filtering data with **SELECT** and **WHERE**  
- Choosing specific columns instead of using `SELECT *`  
- Checking table structure and using **LIMIT** for safe exploration  
- Finding unique values with **DISTINCT** to deduplicate outputs

# Day 1 - Solution

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT service
FROM services_weekly;
